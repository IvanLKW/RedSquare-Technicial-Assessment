# Backend Test

### Question 1
The Python code file **TechTest4-1.py** is written to have the function f(n) in which when it is inside the loop:
1. When the counter is divisable by 3, print "fizz"
2. When the counter is divisable by 5, print "buzz"
3. When the counter is divisable by both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz"
4. Or else print out the number

#### Sample result when f(15) is entered
```
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
```

### Question 2
The Python code file **TechTest4-2.py** is an API Service for a Random Hash Machine Application. The API is created using the FastAPI library.
There are two endpoints on this API whereby:
1. Endpoint 1 returns a random hash string using SHA-256 algorithm generated using the *secrets* library.
2. Endpoint 2 checks the last character of the string and see if it is numeric and odd number to send a success response body.

There is also a seperate Python code file **loadTest.py** to make a request every second from endpoint 2.

#### Sample result
```

```
